    //Use the // to create single line comments to either add info or to take out code for debugging
    //We will be using System.out.println and System.out.print throughout the year. Try using both below to see what the difference is!






    //ANSWER: 



    //Throughout the year this year we will need to store information. For that we will be using VARIABLES!

    //Java is an Object-Oriented programming language. All variables we use this year will either be OBJECTS or PRIMITIVES

    //There are 8 primitives in Java: int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, char

    //For AP we need to know: int, double, boolean

    //List examples of the types below and give definition
    //int (integer): 
    //double:
    //boolean:

    //For now we are just going to work with primitive

    //Create 3 variables of each of the above types (USE GOOD CODING PRACTICE WHEN CREATING THE VARIABLES
    int pcA = 1;
    int pcB = 2;
    int pcC = 3;

    double price = 20.9;
    double pi = 3.14;
    double weather = 81.2;

    boolean Goodweather = weather >= 81;
    boolean Bigprice = price < 22;
    
    System.out.print("I want to buy it for ");

    System.out.print(price);


    //MATH TIME!

    //What are the math operators that we can use?
    //+ - * / %

    //Try doing some math operations with numbers. How can we check to see if the math worked?
    int sum = pcA + pcB;
    System.out.println(sum);
    System.out.println(5+7);
    //Create codes 
   
    
    //Odd integers from 1 to 100, inclusive of both



    //All multiples of 3 from 1 to 100




    //Starting at 1000, print on the same line (with a - [hypthen] between each) all of the numbers that end in 0 going down to 0

//   public static void main(String[] args) {
